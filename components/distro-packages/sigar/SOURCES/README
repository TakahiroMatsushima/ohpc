This tarball of sigar 1.6.5 was gleened from the .src RPM from the
latest Fedora release (Fedora 21). A copy is stored here that was obtained from:

http://linux-ftp.jf.intel.com/pub/mirrors/fedora/linux/releases/21/Everything/source/SRPMS/s/

Although 1.6.5 does not show up as being formally realeased on the
sigar web page, the distro's have beein using variants of 1.6.5 for
some time. Consequently, going with this latest version for now.
