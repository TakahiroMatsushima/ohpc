### OpenHPC: Community building blocks for HPC systems. (v1.2.1)

---

#### Introduction

This stack provides a variety of common, pre-built ingredients required to
deploy and manage an HPC Linux cluster including provisioning tools, resource
management, I/O clients, runtimes, development tools, and a variety of
scientific libraries.

The compatible OS version(s) for this release and the total number of
pre-packaged RPMs available per architecture type are summarized as follows:

Base OS     | x86_64             | aarch64            | noarch
:---:       | :---:              | :---:              | :---:
CentOS 7.2  | 310 (+34 Updates) | 198 (+20 Updates) | 43
SLES 12 SP1 | 312 (+34 Updates) | 205 (+21 Updates) | 43

A detailed list of all available components is available in
the "Package Manifest" appendix located in each of the companion install
guide documents, and a list of updated packages can be found in the
[release notes](https://github.com/openhpc/ohpc/releases/tag/v1.2.1.GA). 

#### Getting started

OpenHPC provides pre-built binaries via repositories for use with standard
Linux package manager tools (e.g. ```yum``` or ```zypper```). Package
repositories are housed at https://build.openhpc.community. To get started, you
can enable an OpenHPC repository locally through installation of an
```ohpc-release``` RPM which includes gpg keys for package signing and defines
the URL locations for [base] and [update] package repositories. Copies of the
```ohpc-release``` package are provided below for convenience. Installtion guides 
taylored for each supported resource manager are also available below or in
the downloads section of the latest
[release](https://github.com/openhpc/ohpc/releases/tag/v1.2.1.GA).
