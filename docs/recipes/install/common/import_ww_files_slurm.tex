\noindent Similarly, to import the global Slurm configuration file and the cryptographic
key that is required by the {\em munge} authentication library to be available
on every host in the resource management pool, issue the following:

% begin_ohpc_run
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,literate={-}{-}1,keywords={},upquote=true]
[sms](*\#*) wwsh file import /etc/slurm/slurm.conf
[sms](*\#*) wwsh file import /etc/munge/munge.key
\end{lstlisting}
% \end_ohpc_run

\noindent Finally, to add {\em optional} support for controlling IPoIB
interfaces (see \S\ref{sec:add_ofed}), \OHPC{} includes a
template file for \Warewulf{} that can optionally be imported and used later to provision
\texttt{ib0} network settings.
